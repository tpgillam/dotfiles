I am Tom's configuration files!

# Installation

## Dependencies

The following should be installed before starting:

- git
- dircolors
- tmux
- neovim
- ripgrep

## Configuration files

Run `./install`. This will install most configuration (idempotently) with some exceptions:

### `bash_profile`
Some subset of the contents of this file should be adapted into `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`,
depending on how your system is configured.

This contains:
* Setup for LS_COLORS
* Nicer prompt
