I am Tom's configuration files!

# Installation

Most configuration files will be installed by running `./install`, with some exceptions:

## `bash_profile`
Some subset of the contents of this file should be adapted into `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`,
depending on how your system is configured.

This contains:
* Setup for LS_COLORS
* Nicer prompt
